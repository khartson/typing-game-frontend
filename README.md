# typing-game-frontend

This repository is the frontend to a Ruby/Sinatra backend [typing game](https://github.com/khartson/phase-3-sinatra-react-project). Users can login with a username,  
choose a typing test of 10, 25, 50, or 100 words, and store the results to their profile, including being able to star exceptional results 
and delete outliers.  

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. Run `npm start` to run the project in your browser. 

In order for this project to run, clone the backend repository and follow the setup instructions  
to get the database running. 

## Credit

Most of the game's logic is handled by jokarz's [react-typing-game hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typing-game-hook)  

Styling was handled with react styles as well as [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), featuring components from  
[headless-ui](https://headlessui.com) and additional icons from [heroicons](https://heroicons.com). Text for the typing tests is  
randomly generated using [faker-js](https://fakerjs.dev). 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
